# Progress Summary - Step-by-Step Validation UI

## What Has Been Built (So Far)

### Backend Changes ‚úÖ DEPLOYED TO RAILWAY

1. **Phase Detail Storage** (`main.py`)
   - Added `phase_details` field to job state
   - Stores comprehensive data for each completed phase
   - Includes timestamps for tracking

2. **New API Endpoint** (`main.py`)
   - `GET /api/dedup/{job_id}/phase/{phase_name}`
   - Returns detailed data for any completed phase
   - Enables click-to-expand functionality

3. **Enhanced Agent Logging** (`agent/dedup_agent.py`)
   - `save_phase_details()` function stores rich data per phase
   - **Phase 1 (Connect)**: SFDC org info
   - **Phase 2 (Extract)**: Full contact list with all fields
   - **Phase 3 (Validate)**: Email validation results + logic explanation
   - **Phase 4 (Detect)**: Duplicate pairs with AI reasoning, comparison fields, model info
   - All phases include completion timestamps

4. **Improved Progress Messages**
   - Conversational step-by-step updates with emojis
   - Shows real data: "Found 21 contacts across 1 account owner"
   - Displays sample data: "Sample contacts: Jack Rogers, Andy Young, Sean Forbes..."
   - Example duplicate preview: "Found 1 duplicate pair(s) - 'Arther Soong' vs 'Arthur Song'"

### Frontend Changes ‚úÖ RUNNING LOCALLY

1. **New PhaseCard Component** (`components/phase-card.tsx`)
   - Expandable phase cards with click-to-expand
   - Context-aware chat per phase
   - Three specialized views:
     - `ContactListView`: Shows extracted contacts with pagination
     - `EmailValidationView`: Displays validation logic + results table
     - `DuplicateAnalysisView`: Shows duplicate pairs with reasoning

2. **Simplified Agent Page** (`app/agent/[id]/page.tsx` - NEW VERSION)
   - ‚ùå **REMOVED**: LangSmith cost tracking UI
   - ‚ùå **REMOVED**: Complex metrics sidebar
   - ‚ùå **REMOVED**: "Scalable to millions" marketing copy
   - ‚úÖ **ADDED**: Clean 2-column layout
     - Left: Job control + activity log
     - Right: Step-by-step phase progress
   - ‚úÖ **ADDED**: Phase cards that appear as workflow progresses
   - ‚úÖ **ADDED**: Inline approval UI when paused
   - ‚úÖ **ADDED**: Context-aware chat (basic implementation)

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ Completed
- Backend phase detail storage and API
- Frontend PhaseCard component
- Simplified page layout without cost tracking
- Basic end-to-end workflow structure

### üöß In Progress
- Testing full workflow with curl
- Enhancing context-aware chat responses
- Polishing UX details

### ‚è≠Ô∏è Next Steps
1. Test full workflow end-to-end with Railway backend
2. Enhance chat to query actual phase data (not hardcoded responses)
3. Add visual polish (animations, loading states)
4. Test approval workflow
5. Deploy frontend to Vercel
6. Final UX review and polish

## Key Design Decisions Made

### Human Validation UX Pattern
Based on research of HITL best practices for 2025, implemented:
- **Inline validation**: Each phase is validated as it completes
- **Expandable details**: Click any completed phase to see full data
- **Context-aware interaction**: Chat understands which phase you're asking about
- **Progressive disclosure**: Start simple, expand for details
- **Clear feedback**: Visual indicators for pending/running/completed states

### Data Architecture
- **Phase details stored separately** from progress updates
- **Queryable by phase name** for efficient loading
- **Immutable once complete** - phases don't change after completion
- **Timestamps for audit trail**

### Removed Complexity
- No cost tracking UI (LangSmith still runs backend, just not shown)
- No complex metrics dashboard
- No "scalable to millions" messaging
- Focus: **Simple, clear, human-reviewable workflow**

## How It Works

### User Flow
1. Click "Start Job"
2. Watch phases appear one by one as agent works
3. Each phase shows progress message (e.g., "Found 21 contacts...")
4. Click any completed phase to expand and see full details
5. In expanded view, ask questions via chat
6. When agent finds duplicates, approval UI appears
7. Review duplicate pairs, approve/reject
8. Job continues to completion

### Technical Flow
1. Frontend calls `/api/dedup/start`
2. Backend creates job, returns job_id
3. Frontend opens WebSocket for real-time updates
4. Agent runs, calling `update_progress()` and `save_phase_details()`
5. WebSocket sends `job_update` messages to frontend
6. Frontend creates PhaseCard for each new phase
7. User clicks to expand ‚Üí Frontend calls `/api/dedup/{job_id}/phase/{phase_name}`
8. Phase details render in appropriate view component
9. User can ask questions ‚Üí Simple keyword matching for now (TODO: Claude API integration)

## Files Changed

### Backend (contacts/)
- `main.py` - Added phase_details storage + GET endpoint
- `agent/dedup_agent.py` - Added save_phase_details() + detailed logging

### Frontend (finora-live/)
- `components/phase-card.tsx` - NEW: Expandable phase component
- `app/agent/[id]/page.tsx` - REPLACED: Simplified validation-focused UI
- `app/agent/[id]/page-old.tsx` - BACKUP: Original complex dashboard

## Testing Notes

### Backend Testing (via curl)
```bash
# Start a job
curl -X POST https://web-production-77576.up.railway.app/api/dedup/start \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"batch_size": null, "owner_filter": null, "auto_approve": false}'

# Get phase details
curl https://web-production-77576.up.railway.app/api/dedup/{job_id}/phase/phase_2_extract
```

### Frontend Testing
- Local dev server running at http://localhost:3000
- Navigate to http://localhost:3000/agent/sfdc-dedup
- Click "Start Job" to test workflow

## Known Issues / TODOs

1. **Chat is Basic**: Currently uses simple keyword matching. Need to integrate Claude API for real conversational responses.

2. **WebSocket Reconnection**: No automatic reconnection if connection drops. Should add reconnection logic.

3. **Error Handling**: Need better error states in PhaseCard when API calls fail.

4. **Loading States**: Add skeleton loaders for phase details fetching.

5. **Duplicate Detection**: Previous runs found 0 duplicates. Need to verify why "Arther Soong" vs "Arthur Song" isn't being caught. May be that these contacts were already processed and marked.

6. **Approval UX**: Need to test full approval workflow end-to-end.

## Questions for User (When You Return)

1. **Chat Functionality**: Do you want the phase chat to actually call Claude API with phase details as context? Or keep it simple keyword-based?

2. **Expandability**: Should ALL phases be expandable, or only certain ones? Currently only phases 2, 3, 4 have details.

3. **Approval Flow**: Want to see approval happen inline in the phase card, or keep it as a separate section below?

4. **Activity Log**: Is the current activity log sufficient, or do you want more detailed logging?

5. **Mobile**: This UI is desktop-focused. Do you need mobile responsive design?

## Git Commits Made

1. `2658d9f` - Add phase detail storage and API endpoints
2. `b3aeefa` - Fix KeyError when displaying duplicate pair names
3. `1eeff4c` - Add conversational step-by-step progress updates to agent

All backend changes have been pushed to Railway and are deploying now.
Frontend changes are local only (not yet committed).
